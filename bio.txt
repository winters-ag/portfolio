I've been in the IT industry since 2018. I've run a company of 50 users as the only IT member. I then moved on to an MSP where I helped manage over 3000 endpoints before moving to a role full time in Microosft's Power Platform. Here I sparked by love of code again and was able to learn a different toolset. While in the power platform I began learning additional things such as the Azure DevOps suite to compliment the Power Platform. Now I use this platform to handle agille project management as well as a repository and pipeline service for my projects. I'm currently completing a MERN full stack coding bootcamp to increase my skillset and move into a more full code environment.
